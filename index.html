    <h1>Princess, My Loyal Friend.</h1>
    <p>When I was born, I was longing for warmth,<br>And as I grew, I was dying again.<br>Dying for affection, for love.<br>I was dying simply for a friend</p>
        
       <p> Though I got all of these,<br> I was always longing for more.<br>Dying to get older,<br>Dying to escape life's pause.</p>
        
        <p>I was dying to find someone,<br>Dying to settle down,<br>Dying to be happier,<br>To have someone to wrap around.</p>
        
        <p>I continued dying every day<br>Until I hit 99 and grew weak.<br>I was dying to see my family,<br>Dying not to fade; this I began to seek.</p>
        
        <p>And then I saw it in that light.<br>I was finally dying for something to give,<br>And I knew that I had been dying for so long<br>That I forgot how to live.</p>
